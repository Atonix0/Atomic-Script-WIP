# Covalent 
(WIP Language)
```
covalent path/to/file # builds results in ./
```

to enter the repl
```
covalent
```
for now it only prints result C code
(REPEL IS VERY WIP IT BUILDS EXE EVERY RUN IN CURRENT DIR)

**you need clang installed in path to compile**

**to build a release run ./build.sh
you only need the covalent exe and ./libs (they should be locatened in same folder)
the release folder is cache for future compile**
